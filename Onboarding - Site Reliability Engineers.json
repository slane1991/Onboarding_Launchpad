Dynatrace enables these best practices by delivering insights that help teams proactively uphold service quality and prevent disruptions before they impact customers.\n  * [Service Level Objectives Overview](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/slo-overview)\n    * SLOs are essential for aligning reliability goals with business priorities, ensuring teams focus on measurable outcomes rather than arbitrary targets. Dynatrace helps enforce these best practices by providing clarity and accountability, enabling proactive decisions to maintain agreed service levels.\n  * [Site Reliability Guardian](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/application-protection)\n    * A site reliability guardian approach ensures continuous oversight of system health, reducing risk by embedding reliability checks into workflows. Dynatrace supports this mindset by enabling automated governance that keeps reliability at the forefront of operational decisions.\n  * [Workflows](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/spm-hub)\n    * Strong security posture management is critical to protect systems from vulnerabilities while maintaining operational resilience. Dynatrace contributes to this discipline by offering visibility that empowers teams to proactively mitigate risks and uphold compliance standards.\n    \n#### [Automation and Capacity planning]\nAutomation and capacity planning are essential for SRE teams to minimise manual intervention, reduce human error, and ensure systems scale reliably under unpredictable demand. Dynatrace supports these best practices by providing actionable insights that help teams proactively optimise resources and maintain resilience without constant firefighting.\n* [Monaco](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/configuration-as-code-monaco)\n  * Monaco was designed within Dynatrace to allow configuring Dynatrace environments at scale and in a reliable and secure way. It represents a lightweight CLI tool that uses native JSON to describe Dynatrace configuration resources.\n* [Workflows](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/workflows)\n  * By using a no-code/low-code, visual interface, organizations can automate repetitive tasks like problem remediation, security responses, and alerting, ensuring consistency and improving efficiency.  \n* [AI in Workflows - Predictive Maintenance of Cloud Disks](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/davis-workflow-integration)\n  * Workflow AI is vital tool as it turns observability data into predictive insights, enabling organisations to anticipate and prevent outages days before they occur.\n* [Predict and autoscale Kubernetes workloads](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/self-service-kubernetes-tutorial)\n  * Are you struggling to keep up with the demands of dynamic Kubernetes environments? Manual scaling is not only time-consuming and reactive, but also prone to errors."},{"id":"68c481f0-f1e7-4639-b389-e60178a678be","type":"links","properties":{"expanded":true},"appearance":"list","title":"Essential Apps","description":"All you need for daily operations.","contentType":"static","content":[{"id":"5244ddb5-c13e-4f9b-9ce4-d6363774c462","type":"link","title":"Service-Level Objectives","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.service.level.objectives/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.service.level.objectives?appVersion=1.10.0","description":"Ensure your system's health and performance"},{"id":"43339f1c-af0c-4778-b685-57e2511637fd","type":"link","title":"Site Reliability Guardian","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian?appVersion=1.22.3","description":"Automates reliability checks by validating SLO's against your services"},{"id":"de1e3aeb-c838-4081-8d06-58fd7375cadb","type":"link","title":"Workflows","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.automations/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.automations?appVersion=1.2311.3","description":"Automatically act on your monitoring data"},{"id":"f41ece8f-7a1d-48a1-9d7b-1d48fb3f01d3","type":"link","title":"Tags","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.settings/ui/settings/builtin:tags.auto-tagging"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.settings?appVersion=1.328.20%2B20251109-180807","description":"Organise your tenant with tags"},{"id":"fe491d4c-4bf8-437b-acdb-870dc6fb299f","type":"link","title":"Synthetic","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.synthetic/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.synthetic?appVersion=1.7.3","description":"Ensure constant availability and performance of your application"},{"id":"83098dd6-d1ee-463a-8ec1-cb49cf57a27b","type":"link","title":"Davis Anomaly Detection","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.davis.anomalydetection/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.davis.anomalydetection?appVersion=1.22.0","description":"Unified overview of all your anomaly detection configurations"},{"id":"340335f2-6e1f-41b1-8e49-cb082ecfb900","type":"link","title":"Distributed Tracing","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.distributedtracing/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.distributedtracing?appVersion=1.21.1","description":"Analyse and drill into trace data at both the request and span levels"},{"id":"361990c3-9bb1-4a59-bc6b-8ede63184d87","type":"link","title":"Security Posture Management","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.security.posturemanagement/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.security.posturemanagement?appVersion=1.6.1","description":"Assess, manage, and remediate misconfigurations and compliance violations against security and regulatory standards"}]},{"id":"d28723b9-68b6-40fe-bc00-3547fe51a2ad","type":"markdown","properties":{"expanded":true},"content":"### [Frequently Asked Questions]()"}],"horizontalLayoutWeight":1}]}}
