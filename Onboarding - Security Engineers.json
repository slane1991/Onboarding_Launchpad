detect and block exploitation attempts on your applications automatically and in real time.\n  * [Security Posture Management](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/spm-hub)\n    * Dynatrace Security Posture Management (SPM) enables you to assess, manage, and take action on misconfigurations and violations against security hardening guidelines and regulatory compliance standards.\n    \n#### [Threat Observability](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/threat-observability)\nExplore example use cases for Dynatrace Application Security\n* [Monitor suspicious sign-in activity with Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/monitor-sign-in-activity)\n  * As organizations embrace cloud technologies, monitoring sign-in logs is crucial for detecting anomalies, investigating suspicious activities, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Real-time visibility into login behavior helps rapidly address security risks, protect user identities, and safeguard critical resources. \n* [Atomate and orchestrate security findings](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/automate-orchestrate-security-findings)\n  * Prioritization and remediation of security findings require a lot of manual effort. With so many different security tools, efficiently orchestrating the findings and focusing on the critical ones becomes impossible. Learn how to break down silos and reduce noise with Dynatrace threat observability.\n* [Visualize and analyze security findings](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/visualize-analyze-security-findings)\n  * Organizations use multiple security products and tools that generate security findings in various data formats. Accessing the data in a siloed approach makes the life of security analysts hard, as they must spend a lot of manual effort generating a combined security posture picture. Explore how Security Analysts can leverage Dynatrace to gain actionable insights in the security space.\n* [Discover coverage gaps in security findings](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/discover-coverage-gaps-security-findings)\n  * Gaining complete visibility of the validation cycle isn't easy, as the scanning products used by different teams silo. Use Dynatrace to aggregate security scans, gain complete visibility into security validations and discover gaps in your security procedures and remediate them before they become a real risk."},{"id":"68c481f0-f1e7-4639-b389-e60178a678be","type":"links","properties":{"expanded":true},"appearance":"list","title":"Essential Apps","description":"All you need for daily operations.","contentType":"static","content":[{"id":"5244ddb5-c13e-4f9b-9ce4-d6363774c462","type":"app","title":"Vulnerabilities","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.security.vulnerabilities"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.security.vulnerabilities?appVersion=2.10.0","categoryId":"apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"43339f1c-af0c-4778-b685-57e2511637fd","type":"app","title":"Third-Party Vulnerabilities","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.classic.vulnerabilities"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.vulnerabilities?appVersion=1.327.34%2B20251103-132803","categoryId":"classic-apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"de1e3aeb-c838-4081-8d06-58fd7375cadb","type":"app","title":"Code-Level Vulnerabilities","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.classic.code.vulnerabilities"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.code.vulnerabilities?appVersion=1.327.34%2B20251103-132803","categoryId":"classic-apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"f41ece8f-7a1d-48a1-9d7b-1d48fb3f01d3","type":"app","title":"Security Posture Management","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.security.posturemanagement"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.security.posturemanagement?appVersion=1.6.1","categoryId":"apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"fe491d4c-4bf8-437b-acdb-870dc6fb299f","type":"app","title":"Security Investigator","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.security.investigator"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.security.investigator?appVersion=1.327.0","categoryId":"apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"83098dd6-d1ee-463a-8ec1-cb49cf57a27b","type":"app","title":"Attacks","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.classic.attacks"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.attacks?appVersion=1.327.34%2B20251103-132803","categoryId":"classic-apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"340335f2-6e1f-41b1-8e49-cb082ecfb900","type":"app","title":"Security Overview","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.classic.security.overview"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.security.overview?appVersion=1.327.34%2B20251103-132803","categoryId":"classic-apps","status":"accessible"},{"id":"361990c3-9bb1-4a59-bc6b-8ede63184d87","type":"app","title":"Logs","action":{"type":"openApp","appId":"dynatrace.logs"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.logs?appVersion=1.17.1","categoryId":"apps","status":"accessible"}]},{"id":"d28723b9-68b6-40fe-bc00-3547fe51a2ad","type":"markdown","properties":{"expanded":true},"content":"### [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/appsec-faq)"}],"horizontalLayoutWeight":1}]}}
