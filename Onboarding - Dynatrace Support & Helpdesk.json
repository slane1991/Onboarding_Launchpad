Documentation\n--- \n \nDynatrace helps support and helpdesk teams triage problems by using Davis AI to automatically pinpoint root causes, correlate events across complex environments, and surface actionable insights reducing time spent on manual investigation and accelerating resolution.\n\n#### [Problem Analysis with Davis® AI]\nAccurate problem analysis is crucial for support and helpdesk teams because it reduces guesswork, shortens resolution times, and prevents recurring issues by addressing the true root cause. Dynatrace enables these best practices by providing clarity and actionable insights that streamline troubleshooting and improve overall service reliability.\n  * [Root Cause Analysis](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/davis-ai-root-cause-concepts)\n    * Instead of chasing symptoms, root cause analysis helps support teams zero in on the actual problem behind an incident. This means faster fixes, fewer repeat issues, and more confidence that the solution truly resolves the customer’s pain point.\n  * [Traces](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/distributed-tracing-app-overview)\n    * Modern applications are complex and interconnected, making it hard to know where things break. Distributed tracing gives teams a clear map of every service interaction, so they can quickly pinpoint bottlenecks or failures across the entire stack.\n  * [User sessions](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/user-session-analysis-new)\n    * Understanding what the user experienced is key to solving problems effectively. User session insights allow teams to replay the journey, see exactly what went wrong, and deliver resolutions that restore trust and improve satisfaction.\n  * [Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/davis-problems-troubleshooting)\n    * When time is critical, having a clear, proven path to resolution matters. Troubleshooting guides provide structured steps and best practices, reducing guesswork and ensuring consistency across the team even for less experienced staff.\n  * [Davis® AI](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/davis-ai-landing)\n    * Manual analysis can be slow and error prone, especially in dynamic environments. Davis AI accelerates this process by intelligently correlating data and highlighting what matters most, helping teams prioritise and resolve issues with confidence.\n    \n#### [Ownership and Alerting]\nClear ownership is essential for support and helpdesk teams to ensure accountability and swift resolution, avoiding delays caused by unclear responsibilities. Dynatrace reinforces this best practice by providing visibility that helps teams assign and manage issues effectively across complex environments.\n* [Ownership](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/ownership)\n  * Clear accountability is essential when multiple teams are involved. Ownership tags make it easy to assign responsibility, avoid confusion, and ensure that issues are handled by the right people without delays.\n* [Workflows](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/workflows)\n  * Repetitive tasks can drain time and energy from support teams. Automated workflows streamline these processes, ensuring that routine actions happen quickly and reliably, so teams can focus on solving complex, high-impact problems.\n* [Connections](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/workflows-actions)\n  * Too many alerts can overwhelm teams, while too few can lead to missed incidents. Smart alerting profiles and workflow connections ensure the right people get the right notifications at the right time, with actionable context to drive rapid response."},{"id":"68c481f0-f1e7-4639-b389-e60178a678be","type":"links","properties":{"expanded":true},"appearance":"list","title":"Essential Apps","description":"All you need for daily operations.","contentType":"static","content":[{"id":"5244ddb5-c13e-4f9b-9ce4-d6363774c462","type":"link","title":"Problems","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.davis.problems/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.davis.problems?appVersion=1.13.1","description":"Review all incidents raised in Dynatrace"},{"id":"43339f1c-af0c-4778-b685-57e2511637fd","type":"link","title":"Dashboards","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.dashboards/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.dashboards?appVersion=1.328.1","description":"Create powerful, data-driven documents for custom analytics"},{"id":"de1e3aeb-c838-4081-8d06-58fd7375cadb","type":"link","title":"Workflows","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.automations/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.automations?appVersion=1.2311.3","description":"Automatically act on your monitoring data"},{"id":"83098dd6-d1ee-463a-8ec1-cb49cf57a27b","type":"link","title":"Connections","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.settings/settings/connections"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.settings?appVersion=1.8.0","description":"Integrate with multiple vendors"},{"id":"340335f2-6e1f-41b1-8e49-cb082ecfb900","type":"link","title":"Distributed Tracing","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.distributedtracing/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.distributedtracing?appVersion=1.21.1","description":"Analyse and drill into trace data at both the request and span levels"},{"id":"f41ece8f-7a1d-48a1-9d7b-1d48fb3f01d3","type":"link","title":"Users & Sessions","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.users.sessions/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.users.sessions?appVersion=1.0.0-preview.328.1","description":"Slice and segment user sessions by OS, browser, location, or tags for deep insights into app behaviour"},{"id":"fe491d4c-4bf8-437b-acdb-870dc6fb299f","type":"link","title":"Session Replay Classic","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.session.replay/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.session.replay?appVersion=1.328.20%2B20251109-180807","description":"Capture and replay the complete digital experience of every user"},{"id":"361990c3-9bb1-4a59-bc6b-8ede63184d87","type":"link","title":"Profiling & Optimization","action":{"type":"openExternalLink","url":"/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.profiling/"},"icon":"/platform/app-engine/registry/v1/app-icons/dynatrace.classic.profiling?appVersion=1.328.20%2B20251109-180807","description":"Set of analysis tools that you can use to manually detect problems"}]},{"id":"d28723b9-68b6-40fe-bc00-3547fe51a2ad","type":"markdown","properties":{"expanded":true},"content":"### [Frequently Asked Questions](https://community.dynatrace.com/t5/Troubleshooting/tkb-p/troubleshooting)"}],"horizontalLayoutWeight":1}]}}
